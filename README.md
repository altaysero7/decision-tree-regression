I used the Decision Tree Regression algorithm to create a model that
predicts phone price ranges based on certain features, such as battery power or
clock speed. The Decision Tree Regression algorithm uses features of an object to
create a trained model that predicts a meaningful continuous output. It uses a
flowchart-like tree structure to model based on pre-learned conditions. The method
is supervised learning and can also work for categorical output variables.
